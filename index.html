        Eating bugs? Who would do that? And why?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Let's start by talking about the harder question: <b>Why?</b>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why eat bugs?
    </h2>
    <p>
        We can break down reasons to eat insects into three main categories:
    <ul>
        <li>Nutritional Benefits</li>
        <li>Health Benefits</li>
        <li>Envriomental Benefits Over Similar Animal Protein Sources</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Nutritional Benefits</h3>
    <p>On average, the protein content of edible insects ranges from about 35%-75% of their dry weight, compared to ~25%
        in lean beef and ~23% in chicken breast</p>

    <p>
        Additionally, with high fat content and low carbohydrate content, insects make the perfect snack for many people
        on specific diets. Take, for instance, a ketogenic diet, in which insects play the perfect role. Additionally,
        although no research on this has been performed, foods with high fat content have been shown to help with lower
        the risk of heart disease and reduce inflammation and it would follow that insects, with their healthy, natural
        fats, would have these effects too.

        Some insects (like grasshoppers, crickets, termites, and mealworms) are rich in iron, zinc, calcium, copper,
        phosphorus, magnesium, and maganese. These minerals are important to help your body produce critical,
        life-sustaining things such as blood cells and muscle mass.

        Finally, some insects like members of the orthoptera(grasshoppers, crickets, and locusts) and
        coleoptera(beetles) orders are high in folic acid, a vitamin important for healthy cell growth and function.

    Additionally, insects provide many health benefits.
    </p>
    <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
    <p>
        Among the most promising insects for wide-scale human consumption sits two main species: Yellow
        mealworms(<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>) and house crickets(<i>Acheta domesticus</i>). Scientists belive that these
        insects are promising for future humans to eat at scale as they are highly nutritious(as pointed out above) and
        mealworms are already fed to many farm animals. Recently, both of these were approved for human consumption in
        Europe.

        These insects are proven to contain high amounts of antioxidants, useful for lowering your risk of many
        diseases, including heart disease and certain cancers. For comparison, some insects contain up to 2-5 times the
        antioxidant capacity of orange juice or olive oil.

        Other studies have demonstrated that the daily administration of mealworm powder showed a active anti-obesity
        effect in mice fed high-fat foods. Additionally, these mealworms showed up to a 90% reduction in the amount of
        fat stored by the animals tested on.

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    Insects can also aid in preventing death from various diseases. In addition to the anti-cancer properties described
    above, flies fed mealworms showed significant old age improvment in locomotive control, even after being injected
    with a suppressant to model Parkinson's Disease, suggesting that insect
    consumption may lead to not only a longer life, but increased resistance to Parkinson's disease.

    Finally, additional insects have shown to help consumers in fighting off malicious infections and destroying
    invasive microbes. This aspect needs further research, but could be of major help to humans.
